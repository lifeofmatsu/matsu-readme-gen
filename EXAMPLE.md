## Installation
The installation instructions are simple! They're so simple, we didn't think we needed to write them out. I mean, how hard can it be, right? You wouldn't happen to be so lost in life that you couldn't do this, right?


## Usage
Well... It looks like you struggled with the installation instructions, so this time we will be generous and provide proper usage explanation with images.


## Features
There are no features worth noting for this project. It just spits out the alphabet backwards. You read the alphabet backwards and pat yourself on the back. Done.


## Contribution
No one in their right mind would contribute to this project, but here's how anyways.


## Tests
Tests? Application quality? Never heard of her.


## Credits
We referenced the dictionary because we didn't know our alphabet.
